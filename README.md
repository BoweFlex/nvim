# Neovim, btw
Packages for my neovim are managed using lazy.nvim. I'm not 100% confident when I say this,
but I'm pretty sure that lazy just needs to be listed in the configuration and kicked off and
doesn't require a manual installation outside of neovim. I'll confirm that when I set this up on
another machine. Git does need to be installed, and a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
is optional but makes a lot of stuff look prettier. I'm currently using Hurmit Nerd Font.
